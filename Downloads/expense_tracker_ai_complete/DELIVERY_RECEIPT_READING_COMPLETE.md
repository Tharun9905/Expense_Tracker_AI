## 💻 Usage Example

```python
from utils.easyocr_processor import extract_receipt_data

# Process receipt image
result = extract_receipt_data('path/to/receipt.jpg')

# Get extracted data
print(f"Amount: {result['amount']}")           # 1413.56
print(f"Date: {result['date']}")              # 2025-11-15
print(f"Merchant: {result['description']}")   # FRESH GROCERY MART
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")  # 0.92 (92%)

# Check confidence before processing
if result['confidence'] > 0.9:
    process_transaction(result)  # High confidence
else:
    flag_for_review(result)      # Low confidence
```
