# Quick Test Guide - Receipt OCR Improvements

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Tesseract (Required for OCR)
```bash
# Windows - Download from:
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

# Or use Chocolatey:
choco install tesseract

# Verify:
tesseract --version
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
cd c:\Users\THARUN\Downloads\expense_tracker_ai_complete\expense_tracker_ai
python app.py
```

### 3. Access Receipt Upload
```
URL: http://localhost:5000/upload_receipt
```

## 📋 Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Receipt (Should Extract All Data)
```
Upload: Standard grocery store receipt image
Expected:
  ✓ Amount: Extracted correctly
  ✓ Date: Shows date from receipt
  ✓ Merchant: Shows store name
✅ PASS: Transaction appears in dashboard
```

### Test 2: Different Currency Formats
```
Upload: Receipt in any format
Expected to handle:
  ✓ $1,234.56 (US format)
  ✓ 1.234,56 EUR (European)
  ✓ ₹ 1,234.56 (Indian Rupee)
  ✓ 1234.56 (simple)
```

### Test 3: Poor Quality Image
```
Upload: Blurry or low-contrast receipt
Processing: Auto-enhanced for better readability
Expected: Better text extraction than before
```

### Test 4: Complex Receipt
```
Upload: Receipt with multiple items, taxes, discounts
Expected: 
  ✓ Extracts TOTAL amount (largest value)
  ✓ Ignores item prices
  ✓ Ignores tax amounts
```

### Test 5: Missing Tesseract
```
Scenario: Run without Tesseract installed
Expected:
  ✓ Shows helpful error message
  ✓ Provides installation link
  ✓ App doesn't crash
  ✓ User can still add transaction manually
```

## 🔍 Checking Logs

### Console Output
```
Processing receipt image: static/uploads/20240115_120530_receipt.jpg
Extracted text length: 348 characters
Extracted - Amount: 45.99, Date: 2024-01-15, Merchant: Best Buy
```

### Error Output (If Tesseract Not Found)
```
Warning: Tesseract OCR not found. OCR functionality will be limited.
Please install Tesseract-OCR from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
```

## 📊 Before & After Comparison

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Amount extraction: Broken due to double replace() bug
❌ Only detected USD format ($123.45)
❌ Often extracted wrong amounts (picked first match, not total)
❌ Poor merchant name detection
❌ No image preprocessing for low-quality images
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Amount extraction: Fixed with smart decimal detection
✅ Supports USD, EUR, INR formats and more
✅ Extracts TOTAL amount (largest value)
✅ Improved merchant name detection
✅ Auto-enhance low-quality images
✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "pytesseract.TesseractNotFoundError"
```
Solution: Install Tesseract from GitHub link above
Windows Path: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```

### Issue 2: Receipt amount shows 0.0
```
Possible Causes:
1. Image quality too poor
2. Receipt format not recognized
3. No numeric values found in image

Solutions:
1. Try clearer receipt image
2. Check image is not upside down
3. Ensure receipt is not blank
```

### Issue 3: Merchant name is wrong
```
Solutions:
1. Ensure store name is visible in image
2. Check store name is not just numbers/symbols
3. Receipt might not have merchant name clearly visible
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Upload high-quality images** (clear, well-lit, not blurry)
2. **Ensure proper alignment** (receipt fill most of image)
3. **Use supported formats** (PNG, JPG, JPEG recommended)
4. **Keep file size reasonable** (< 5MB)
