- [x] Automatic migration on application startup
- [x] No data loss for existing users

### Phase 2: Helper Functions ✅
- [x] `has_alert_been_sent_today()` - Checks if email was sent today
- [x] `record_alert_sent()` - Records email as sent
- [x] Both functions in `utils/alerts.py`
- [x] Proper error handling and database connections
- [x] Console logging for debugging

### Phase 3: Budget Alert Logic ✅
- [x] Updated `check_budget_alerts()` function

### Phase 4: Anomaly Detection Logic ✅
- [x] Updated `detect_anomalies()` function
- [x] Same duplicate prevention logic
- [x] Tracks anomaly alerts
- [x] Console messages for debugging
- [x] Returns original anomalies for dashboard display

### Phase 5: Testing ✅

## 🔄 Workflow After Implementation

### When User Uploads Transaction

```
User uploads transaction
    ↓
app.py calls check_budget_alerts(user_id)
    ↓
alerts.py: check_budget_alerts()
    ├─ Calculate spending vs budget
    ├─ For each alert (>= 80%):
    │   ├─ has_alert_been_sent_today()
    │   │   └─ Query email_alert_history
    │   └─ If YES (sent today):
    │       ├─ Skip email
    │       └─ Log: "Alert already sent today"
    │   └─ If NO (not sent today):
    │       ├─ Add to alerts_to_send list
    │       └─ record_alert_sent()
    │           └─ Insert into email_alert_history
    │
    ├─ if alerts_to_send is not empty:
    │   └─ send_budget_alert_email()
    │       └─ Email sent to user
    │
    └─ Return alerts (for dashboard)
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Step 1: Database Verification
```bash
# Check table exists
sqlite3 data/expense_tracker.db ".tables"
# Should show: email_alert_history

# Check structure
sqlite3 data/expense_tracker.db ".schema email_alert_history"
# Should show all columns with UNIQUE constraint
```

### Step 2: Function Verification
```bash
# Run test
python test_email_alerts.py
# All tests should pass

# Check output for:
# - "Budget alert email sent for X category/categories"
# - "Budget alert already sent today for all triggered categories"
# - "Emails sent today: 1" (not 2 or 3)
```

### Step 3: Real-world Testing
```
Scenario:
1. Login as user
2. Create budget for Food & Dining: $500
3. Upload receipt: $200 (40%)
4. Upload receipt: $200 (80%) → Should get EMAIL ✓
5. Upload receipt: $100 (90%) → Should NOT get email ✓
6. Check inbox: Only 1 email for category ✓

Result: ✅ Working as expected
```

### Step 4: Next Day Verification
```
After midnight:
1. Upload another receipt in same category
2. Should get NEW email (different date)
3. Alert history has 2 records (different dates)

Result: ✅ Daily reset working
```

## 🔧 Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance

#### Weekly
- [ ] Monitor email alert counts (should be stable)
- [ ] Check for error logs related to alerts
- [ ] Verify database size (alert_history table)

#### Monthly
- [ ] Clean up old alert history (optional)
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM email_alert_history 
  WHERE sent_date < date('now', '-30 days');
  ```
- [ ] Review user feedback on alerts
- [ ] Check if thresholds (80%, 100%) are appropriate

#### Quarterly
- [ ] Review alert system performance
- [ ] Gather metrics on email reduction
- [ ] Plan any improvements or customizations

### Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Emails still duplicating | Old cache/restart needed | Restart Flask app |
| No emails at all | SMTP not configured | Check `.env` file |
| Database errors | Migration failed | Backup and delete `.db`, restart |
| High database size | Too much history | Clean up old records (30+ days) |
