### **To Developers:**

Additional topics to cover:

6. **"Project Structure"**
   - `app.py` - Main application (200+ lines)
   - `models/database.py` - Database setup
   - `utils/` - Core business logic
   - `templates/` - HTML pages
   - `static/` - CSS, JS, uploads
   - `data/` - SQLite database

7. **"Key Python Files to Know"**
   - `ai_categorizer.py` - AI expense categorization
   - `ocr_processor.py` - Receipt scanning
   - `alerts.py` - Budget alerts
   - `analytics.py` - Reports
   - `email_service.py` - Notifications

8. **"Database Operations"**
   - SQLite database in `data/expense_tracker.db`
   - Auto-created on first run
   - Reset by deleting database file
   - Schema defined in `models/database.py`

9. **"Optional Features Setup"**
   - Email: Create `.env` from `.env.template`
   - OCR: Install Tesseract (optional, app works without)

10. **"Common Development Tasks"**
    - Change port: Edit `app.py` app.run(port=XXXX)
    - Enable debug: `set FLASK_DEBUG=1`
    - Add new route: Add function in `app.py`
    - Modify database: Edit `models/database.py`

---

### **To DevOps/Deployment Team:**

11. **"Production Deployment"**
    - Use Gunicorn instead of Flask dev server
    - Update `SECRET_KEY` in app.py
    - Configure SSL/HTTPS
    - Set up reverse proxy (nginx)
    - Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for scale

12. **"Performance Considerations"**
    - Current: SQLite (good for development)
    - Scale: Use PostgreSQL
    - Max upload: 16 MB per file
    - Typical memory: ~80 MB
    - OCR processing: 5-10 seconds first time

13. **"Monitoring & Maintenance"**
    - Monitor port 5000 (or configured port)
    - Backup database regularly
    - Watch for disk space (uploads folder)
    - Check error logs
    - Monitor email delivery status
